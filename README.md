Booking.com Test Automation Framework
This repository contains a test automation framework for the booking.com website. The framework is designed to automate various scenarios related to user interactions on the website using Selenium WebDriver, Java, TestNG, and the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern.

Tools and Frameworks Used
Selenium WebDriver: A popular open-source library for automating web browsers. It provides APIs to interact with web elements, simulate user actions, and perform assertions.

Java: The programming language used to write the automation scripts. Java offers a rich set of libraries, object-oriented features, and platform independence.

TestNG: A testing framework that enhances and extends JUnit. It provides features like parallel test execution, grouping, and reporting.

ExtentReports: A reporting library that generates detailed and visually appealing test reports. It provides insights into test execution results, logs, and screenshots.

Page Object Model (POM): A design pattern that separates the representation of web elements and their interactions from the test scripts. POM enhances code modularity, reusability, and maintainability.

The test run using this framework went pretty well. This framework is scalable and can be integrated with CI/CD pipeline to automate tests and get to deployment faster.
Feel free to clone this project and use the testing framework as your base.
