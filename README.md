Booking.com Test Automation Framework
This repository contains a test automation framework for the booking.com website.
The framework is designed to automate various scenarios related to user interactions on a website using Selenium WebDriver, Java, TestNG, and the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern.

Tools and Frameworks Used
Selenium WebDriver: A popular open-source library for automating web browsers. It provides APIs to interact with web elements, simulate user actions, and perform assertions.

Java: The programming language used to write the automation scripts. Java offers a rich set of libraries, object-oriented features, and platform independence.

TestNG: A testing framework that enhances and extends JUnit. It provides features like parallel test execution, grouping, and reporting.

ExtentReports: A reporting library that generates detailed and visually appealing test reports. It provides insights into test execution results, logs, and screenshots.

Page Object Model (POM): A design pattern that separates the representation of web elements and their interactions from the test scripts. POM enhances code modularity, usability, and maintainability.
